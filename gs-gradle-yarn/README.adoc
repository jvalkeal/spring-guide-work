This guide walks you through using Gradle to build a simple Spring YARN project.

== What you'll build

You'll create a simple app and then build it using Gradle.

NOTE: In this guide we are not trying to create fully working YARN application, instead we focus on project and build model.

== What you'll need

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor or IDE
 - {jdk}[JDK 6] or later


include::https://raw.github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/how_to_complete_this_guide.adoc[]

If you're not familiar with gradle or don't have it installed, refer to link:/guides/gs/gradle[Building Java Projects with Gradle].

== Set up the project

First you set up a Java project for Gradle to build. To keep the focus on Gradle, make the project as simple as possible for now.

include::https://raw.github.com/jvalkeal/spring-guide-work/master/macros/create_directory_structure_yarn_hello.adoc[]

Firts, let's create a `ContainerApplication` class.

`gs-gradle-yarn-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-gradle-yarn-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java[]
----

Next, we create an `AppmasterApplication` class.

`gs-gradle-yarn-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-gradle-yarn-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java[]
----

The last Java class we need to create is a `ClientApplication` class.

`gs-gradle-yarn-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-gradle-yarn-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java[]
----

Now we need to create an `application` YAML configuration file for all
sub-projects.

`gs-gradle-yarn-container/src/main/resources/application.yml`
`gs-gradle-yarn-appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml`
`gs-gradle-yarn-client/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-gradle-yarn-container/src/main/resources/application.yml[]

== Understanding Gradle Usage with Spring YARN

We need to create a `build.gradle` file where we define everything needed for the build.

We will be using the Spring Boot Gradle plugin so `repository` and `dependency` needs to be defined within a `buildscript` section.

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tags=snippetA]
----

Below that section we add the following -- project version as `0.1.0`,
apply plugins for `java`, `eclipse`, `idea` and add `repositories` to
resolve all of the third party jar dependencies via Maven
repositories.

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tags=snippetB]
----

Next we add `spring-boot` plugin, `spring-yarn-boot` maven
dependency to all sub-projects. Additionally we create a `copyJars`
task to copy created jars from a sub-projects into a root project.
This will make things easier to test and run your application.

The Gradle plugin for `Spring Boot` automatically creates a task to
repackage a main jar file created from a project.

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tags=snippetC]
----

Next, related to what we previously did, we add a compile dependency
for all sub-projects. This is required later guided when we create
tests in a root project.

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tags=snippetD]
----

We add configure section for each sub-project. These are empty for now
but needed in further guides when more specific dependencies are
added.

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tags=snippetE]
----

Last we just add a normal gradle wrapper task which is not needed for
project itself but allows to use this build file without installing
gradle binaries.

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tags=snippetF]
----

include::https://raw.github.com/jvalkeal/spring-guide-work/master/macros/describe_shdp_yarn_deps_gradle.adoc[]

== Build Application Packages

Run build.

[source,text]
----
gradle clean build
----

You should see three jar files created.

[source,text]
----
build/libs/gs-yarn-gradle-client-0.1.0.jar
build/libs/gs-yarn-gradle-container-0.1.0.jar
build/libs/gs-yarn-gradle-appmaster-0.1.0.jar
----

You can run the project with `java -jar build/libs/gs-yarn-gradle-client-0.1.0.jar` but we haven't added the code to 
actually submit the YARN application yet. So, all you will see is some logging mesages. You will build a complete
application that you can submit to YARN in the other Getting Started Guides for Spring YARN.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have now created a simple yet effective Gradle build file for building Spring YARN projects.
